00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.500
Welcome. Today we’ll practice box breathing—a steady rhythm to calm your body and steady your attention.

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:16.000
It’s four parts: breathe in for four, hold for four, breathe out for four, hold for four.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:26.000
You don’t need to count out loud. A circle on the screen will expand, pause, contract, and pause with you.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:33.000
We’ll try a short round together, then set a tiny plan for your day.
