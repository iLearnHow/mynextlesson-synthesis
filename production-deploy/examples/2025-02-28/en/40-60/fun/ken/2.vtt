00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Question two: Which timing is safer and more helpful for most days?

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Short morning light most days, or a long midday session once a week?

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Coaching: morning light resets your body clock and supports mood with lower burn risk.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:34.000
If midday is the only option, shorten the exposure and add shade.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Microâ€‘habit: ten minutes before 10 a.m., without sunglasses if comfortable and safe.
