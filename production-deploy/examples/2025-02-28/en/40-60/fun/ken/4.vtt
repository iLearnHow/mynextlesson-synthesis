Small, safe daylight is a signal, not a chore. It tells your brain: “It’s daytime—be steady.”

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:17.000
This week, aim for short morning light most days. On cloudy or busy days, step out for two minutes.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:26.000
You can link it to coffee or your first message of the day—tiny, consistent, and doable.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Tomorrow we’ll connect light to sleep timing, so nights feel calmer and mornings feel easier.
