# 🔍 TTS Status Report - What's REALLY Happening

## Current Reality on ilearnhow.com:

### ❌ What's NOT Working:
1. **Using Browser TTS (Robot Voice)**
   - Console shows: "TTS not ready, using fallback audio"
   - This is the generic browser `speechSynthesis`
   - NOT Kelly/Ken voices

2. **Generated Audio Not Loading**
   - The 20 AIFF files we created aren't being used
   - Path issue: `/generated_audio/` doesn't exist on live site
   - These files weren't deployed to Cloudflare

3. **Autoplay Blocked**
   - Browser security blocks audio without user interaction
   - Need click-to-start mechanism

### ✅ What IS Working:
1. **Pre-recorded MP3s**
   - `/production-deploy/examples/.../0_full.mp3` files work
   - But only cover 3 lessons
   - Limited scalability

## 🎯 The Truth About Our TTS:

| What We Have | Status | Being Used? |
|--------------|--------|-------------|
| Training WAV files (60 min) | ✅ Exists locally | ❌ No |
| Generated AIFF files (20) | ✅ Created locally | ❌ Not deployed |
| Pre-recorded MP3s | ✅ Deployed | ✅ Yes (limited) |
| Browser speechSynthesis | ✅ Always available | ✅ Yes (fallback) |
| Trained AI models | ❌ Not created | ❌ No |

## 🛠️ Immediate Fixes Needed:

### 1. Deploy Generated Audio
```bash
# The AIFF files need to be converted and deployed
cd generated_audio
for f in kelly/*.aiff; do 
  ffmpeg -i "$f" "${f%.aiff}.mp3"
done
for f in ken/*.aiff; do 
  ffmpeg -i "$f" "${f%.aiff}.mp3"
done
```

### 2. Fix Modal Position
- Currently covers Kelly's face
- Move to top-right corner
- Auto-close after selection

### 3. Fix Audio Autoplay
- Add "Click to Start" overlay
- Initialize audio context on user interaction
- Then auto-play works

## 📊 What Students Currently Experience:

1. Open site → See lesson selector over Kelly's face ❌
2. Click lesson → Hear robot voice (not Kelly) ❌  
3. Console shows errors ❌
4. Confusing experience ❌

## 🚀 Next Steps Priority:

### TODAY (Critical):
1. Move lesson selector out of avatar's face
2. Add click-to-start for audio
3. Fix console errors

### THIS WEEK (Important):
1. Convert AIFF → MP3 
2. Deploy generated audio files
3. Test all audio paths

### NEXT WEEK (Enhancement):
1. Train actual AI models
2. Implement dynamic generation
3. Full 366-lesson coverage

## 💡 The Real Solution:

We need to either:
- **Option A**: Generate all 896 audio files (448 Kelly + 448 Ken)
- **Option B**: Train the AI models for dynamic generation
- **Option C**: Use better system voices as interim solution

Currently we're stuck with Option C (browser TTS) which sounds robotic and doesn't match Kelly/Ken.
