## 🚀 Deploy in 3 Commands:

```bash
# 1. Install Railway CLI (if needed)
npm install -g @railway/cli

# 2. Login
railway login

# 3. Deploy!
railway link  # Create new project when prompted
railway up    # Deploy the server
railway domain # Get your URL
```

## 📝 What I Need From You:

1. **Create Railway Account**: https://railway.app
2. **Add Payment Method**: Required for 4GB RAM
3. **Run the Commands**: I can't access external services
4. **Share the URL**: Once deployed, tell me the URL

## 🎯 After Deployment:

1. Test with: `./test-production-tts.sh YOUR_RAILWAY_URL`
2. Update DNS or code with the new URL
3. No more macOS voices! 🎉

**Ready? Just run those 3 commands above!**

Once you get the Railway URL, tell me and I'll help you update the DNS or code.
