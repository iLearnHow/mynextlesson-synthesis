Question two: Which timing is safer and more helpful for most days?

00:00:08.055 --> 00:00:18.055
Short morning light most days, or a long midday session once a week?

00:00:18.332 --> 00:00:28.332
Coaching: morning light resets your body clock and supports mood with lower burn risk.

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:38.609
If midday is the only option, shorten the exposure and add shade.

00:00:38.886 --> 00:00:47.775
Microâ€‘habit: ten minutes before 10 a.m., without sunglasses if comfortable and safe.
