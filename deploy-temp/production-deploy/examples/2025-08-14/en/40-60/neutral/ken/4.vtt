00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Steady breath is a tool you carry everywhere.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:15.000
This week, link two quiet cycles to something you already do—opening your laptop, waiting for a call to start, or stepping outside.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:23.000
If a moment feels sharp today, do one gentle cycle. You’ll feel the edges soften.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.500
I’ll see you tomorrow.
