# Background Lesson Processor - User Guide

This background agent processes all 366 lessons from the iLearnHow curriculum one by one, generating detailed scripts with all variants for each lesson.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Running the Background Agent

1. **Start in foreground mode (recommended for first run):**
   ```bash
   ./run-background-agent.sh
   ```

2. **Start as background daemon:**
   ```bash
   ./run-background-agent.sh --daemon
   ```

3. **Resume from last checkpoint:**
   ```bash
   ./run-background-agent.sh --daemon --resume
   ```

### Monitoring Progress

1. **Single status check:**
   ```bash
   node monitor-lesson-processing.js
   ```

2. **Continuous monitoring (updates every 5 seconds):**
   ```bash
   node monitor-lesson-processing.js --continuous
   ```

## üìÅ File Structure

- `background-lesson-processor.js` - Main processor script
- `run-background-agent.sh` - Shell script to run the processor
- `monitor-lesson-processing.js` - Monitoring tool
- `lesson-processing-progress.json` - Progress tracking file (auto-generated)
- `lesson-processing-errors.log` - Error log file (auto-generated)
- `generated-lessons/` - Output directory for generated scripts

## üîß Features

### One-by-One Processing
- Processes each lesson individually with a 2-second delay between lessons
- No batch processing - ensures quality and allows for monitoring

### Progress Tracking
- Automatically saves progress after every 10 lessons
- Can resume from the last processed lesson if interrupted
- Tracks both successful and failed lessons

### Error Handling
- Retries failed lessons up to 3 times
- Logs all errors to `lesson-processing-errors.log`
- Continues processing even if individual lessons fail

### Generated Content
For each lesson, the processor generates:
- 9 variants (3 age groups √ó 3 tones)
- Introduction, questions, activities, and conclusion for each variant
- Voiceover scripts and avatar mood configurations
- Estimated duration for each age group

## üìä Output Format

Each generated lesson is saved as a JSON file in the `generated-lessons/` directory with the following structure:

```json
{
  "lessonId": 1,
  "date": "January 1",
  "title": "The Sun - Our Magnificent Life-Giving Star",
  "learningObjective": "...",
  "variants": {
    "early_childhood": {
      "grandmother": { ... },
      "fun": { ... },
      "neutral": { ... }
    },
    "youth": { ... },
    "young_adult": { ... }
  }
}
```

## üõë Stopping the Processor

### If running in foreground:
Press `Ctrl+C` - progress will be saved automatically

### If running as daemon:
1. Find the PID:
   ```bash
   cat lesson_processor.pid
   ```

2. Stop the process:
   ```bash
   kill <PID>
   ```

## ‚è±Ô∏è Time Estimates

- Average processing time per lesson: ~5-7 seconds
- Total time for 366 lessons: ~30-45 minutes
- The monitor will show real-time ETR (Estimated Time Remaining)

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Processor won't start
- Check if another instance is running: `cat lesson_processor.pid`
- Remove stale PID file if needed: `rm lesson_processor.pid`

### No progress shown
- Ensure the processor has started and created the progress file
- Check logs in `logs/` directory if running as daemon

### High error rate
- Check `lesson-processing-errors.log` for details
- Ensure all required files are in place (variant generator, curriculum data)
- Verify Node.js version compatibility

## üìà Performance Tips

1. **Run during off-peak hours** to avoid impacting other processes
2. **Monitor disk space** - each lesson generates a ~50-100KB JSON file
3. **Check error logs regularly** to catch issues early
4. **Use daemon mode** for long runs to prevent terminal disconnection issues

## üéØ Complete Workflow

1. Start the processor:
   ```bash
   ./run-background-agent.sh --daemon
   ```

2. Monitor progress:
   ```bash
   node monitor-lesson-processing.js --continuous
   ```

3. Check completion:
   ```bash
   ls generated-lessons/ | wc -l
   ```

4. Review any errors:
   ```bash
   cat lesson-processing-errors.log
   ```

## üí° Notes

- The processor integrates with your existing variant generator
- Each lesson is processed with full error handling and retry logic
- Progress is persistent - you can stop and resume at any time
- Generated files use a consistent naming convention for easy organization

Happy processing! üéâ
