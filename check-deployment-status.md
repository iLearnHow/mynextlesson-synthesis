# Deployment Status Check

## Current Issues

### 1. **Avatar Images** ✅ FIXED
- R2 structure was wrong: `/avatars/ken/full/E/frame_01.webp` not `/avatars/ken/full/E.png`
- Updated all references in:
  - `avatar-sync-player.js`
  - `test-avatar-sync.html`
  - `index.html`

### 2. **TTS Server** ❌ STILL DOWN
```bash
# Both URLs returning 502 errors:
curl https://tts.ilearnhow.com/health
# 502 Bad Gateway

curl https://tts-server-production-61b7.up.railway.app/health
# 502 Application failed to respond
```

The Railway server is likely stuck on Coqui license prompt because the environment variables haven't taken effect.

## Action Required

### Railway Dashboard
1. Go to your Railway dashboard
2. Find the `tts-server` service
3. Click on "Variables" tab
4. Verify these are set:
   - `COQUI_TOS_AGREED`: `1`
   - `FLASK_ENV`: `production`
   - `STRICT_TTS`: `1`
   - `PORT`: `5002`

5. **IMPORTANT**: Click "Redeploy" or trigger a new deployment
   - The 21-minute-old deployment doesn't have the new env vars
   - Railway needs a new deployment to pick up env var changes

### Test Locally Now
The avatar images should work now at:
http://localhost:8045/test-avatar-sync.html

You should see:
- Kelly or Ken avatar (from R2)
- When you click "Test Kelly Voice", it will fallback to heuristic animation
- Frames should switch even without TTS server

### Once Railway Redeploys
The full system will work with:
- Real phoneme timing from TTS
- Proper Ken/Kelly voices
- Accurate lip sync
