# 🎯 FINAL HANDOFF - iLearnHow Universal Lesson System

## 📅 **Handoff Date: August 4, 2025**

### 🚨 **CRITICAL FIX IMPLEMENTED**

**Issue**: Ken and Kelly avatars were not loading due to incorrect file paths when opening HTML directly via `file://` protocol.

**Root Cause**: Absolute paths starting with `/` don't work when opening HTML files directly in browser.

**Fix Applied**: 
- Changed all avatar paths from `/lesson-player-deploy/...` to `lesson-player-deploy/...`
- Updated CSS, JavaScript, and inline styles
- Ensured immediate avatar loading on page initialization

**Status**: ✅ **FIXED** - Ken and Kelly now load as primary visual experience
