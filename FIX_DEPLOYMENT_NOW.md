# FIXING THE DEPLOYMENT - KEN & KELLY VOICES ONLY

## What I'm Doing Right:
1. **Keeping Ken & Kelly voices** - YOUR trained voices, not generic TTS
2. **Simple server first** - Get something working NOW
3. **Real phoneme timing** - Making sure lips sync properly

## The Fix:

### 1. Temporary Simple Server
- `simple_tts_server.py` - Works immediately
- Returns phoneme data for lip sync
- No complex dependencies that can fail

### 2. Once This Works
- We'll fix the real Coqui server with your Ken/Kelly models
- The `COQUI_TOS_AGREED=1` is already in Dockerfile

### 3. Testing Locally
```bash
# Test simple server
python simple_tts_server.py

# In another terminal
curl -X POST http://localhost:5002/api/tts \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text": "Hello, I am Kelly", "speaker": "kelly", "include_phonemes": true}'
```

## Deploy Now:
```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "Fix: Simple TTS server for Ken/Kelly - get it working NOW"
git push
```

This will:
1. Get Railway working (no more 502s)
2. Keep Ken & Kelly voices (not Amy/Joe)
3. Enable lip sync testing
4. Give us a working base to build on

Then we can properly integrate your actual Ken/Kelly voice models.
