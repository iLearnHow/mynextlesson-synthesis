## 🔧 **STRUCTURAL CHANGES IMPLEMENTED**

### **1. ✅ New HTML Structure:**
```html
<!-- OLD (Incorrect) -->
<div class="ios-note question-label" title="Loading question...">Q1</div>
<div class="ios-note choice-note choice-a" onclick="selectChoice('A', 'beginning')">Loading...</div>

<!-- NEW (Correct) -->
<div class="ios-note question-text" id="beginning-question">Loading question...</div>
<div class="ios-note choice-note choice-a" onclick="selectChoice('A', 'beginning')">
    <div class="choice-text">Loading...</div>
    <div class="teaching-moment" style="display: none;"></div>
</div>
```

### **2. ✅ Enhanced CSS Styling:**
```css
/* Question Text */
.question-text {
    font-size: 18px;
    font-weight: 600;
    color: #007AFF;
    text-align: center;
    margin-bottom: 20px;
    padding: 16px;
    background: rgba(0, 122, 255, 0.05);
    border-radius: 12px;
    border: 1px solid rgba(0, 122, 255, 0.1);
    max-width: 400px;
    line-height: 1.4;
}

/* Choice Buttons */
.choice-note {
    width: 200px;
    height: auto;
    min-height: 80px;
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    /* ... enhanced styling ... */
}

/* Teaching Moments */
.teaching-moment {
    font-size: 12px;
    color: #666;
    font-style: italic;
    padding-top: 8px;
    border-top: 1px solid rgba(0, 122, 255, 0.1);
    margin-top: 8px;
    line-height: 1.3;
}
```

### **3. ✅ Updated JavaScript Logic:**
```javascript
// Question Display
const questionText = document.querySelector(`#${phaseType}-phase .question-text`);
if (questionText && phaseContent.question_text) {
    questionText.textContent = phaseContent.question_text;
}

// Choice Content
const choiceTextA = choiceA.querySelector('.choice-text');
if (choiceTextA) {
    choiceTextA.textContent = phaseContent.choices.option_a.text;
}

// Inline Teaching Moments
const teachingMoment = choiceElement.querySelector('.teaching-moment');
if (teachingMoment && selectedChoice.teaching_moment) {
    const age = this.settings.age;
    const tone = this.settings.tone;
    const teachingMomentText = selectedChoice.teaching_moment[tone]?.[age];
    teachingMoment.textContent = teachingMomentText;
    teachingMoment.style.display = 'block';
}
```
