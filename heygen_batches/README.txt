HeyGen Batches

Use these to render long-form 30-minute videos per batch:
- Choose avatar Ken or Kelly, neutral pose; disable music; keep head steady.
- Paste the entire batch text into the script field.
- Render at normal speed.
- Download the output and export Audio as WAV mono 24 kHz if available (or download MP4 and we will extract audio).

Next, place outputs here when ready:
- Audio: ~/tts_corpus/ken/ken_batch_XX.wav (or .mp4)
- Audio: ~/tts_corpus/kelly/kelly_batch_XX.wav (or .mp4)
- Transcript: use the exact text of batch_XX.txt as the .lab transcript.

We will align with MFA and auto-segment into utterances.
