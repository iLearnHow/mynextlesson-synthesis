# iLearn How - Cursor Rules

## CORE PRINCIPLES
- NEVER create new HTML pages or lesson players
- ALWAYS work within the existing codebase structure
- ALWAYS use the existing index.html as the main interface
- NEVER create parallel systems or standalone pages
- ALWAYS implement real functionality, never placeholder content

## EXISTING CODEBASE STRUCTURE
- index.html (2618 lines) - Main interface, MUST be enhanced, not replaced
- complete-curriculum.js - Curriculum data system
- corrected-variant-generator-v2.js - Variant generation system
- complete-lesson-player.js - Lesson player functionality
- complete-elevenlabs-integration.js - Audio integration
- data/ - Monthly curriculum JSON files

## FORBIDDEN ACTIONS
- Creating new HTML files (working-version.html, test-*.html, diagnostic.html)
- Creating new lesson player systems
- Creating standalone test pages
- Replacing existing architecture with new designs
- Creating parallel systems

## REQUIRED ACTIONS
- Enhance existing index.html to display real content
- Fix content integration within existing lesson player
- Work within the existing 2,618-line index.html structure
- Use existing curriculum data and variant systems
- Implement real functionality, not placeholders

## SUCCESS CRITERIA
- index.html displays real lesson content from curriculum
- Variant system works within existing interface
- Audio integration functions within existing system
- No new files created, only existing files enhanced
- All functionality works within existing architecture

## ENFORCEMENT
- If asked to create new pages, redirect to enhancing existing index.html
- If asked to test systems, test within existing index.html
- If asked to demonstrate functionality, demonstrate within existing system
- Always reference existing files, never create new ones
