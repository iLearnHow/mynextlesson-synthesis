## ðŸŽ¯ Age Adaptation Guidelines

### **Age Groups and Characteristics:**

- **age_12 (Pre-teen)**: Beginning abstract thinking, peer connections
- **age_16 (Teen)**: Identity development, social awareness, future thinking
- **age_25 (Young Adult)**: Career/relationship focus, practical applications
- **age_40 (Adult)**: Life experience integration, family/work balance
- **age_60 (Mature)**: Wisdom sharing, legacy thinking, health awareness  
- **age_80 (Senior)**: Life reflection, simplified interaction, comfort focus

### **Content Adaptation Tips:**
```json
// Age 2 Example
"content": "Do [animals] like hugs?",
"teaching_moment": "Yes! [Animals] love gentle hugs, just like you!"

// Age 8 Example  
"content": "Why do [animals] behave the way they do?",
"teaching_moment": "[Animals] are like us - they have feelings and needs that guide their actions."

## ðŸŽ® Testing Your Lesson

### **Load in Player:**
1. Save your JSON file in the `lessons/` folder
2. Open `universal-lesson-player.html`  
3. Modify the `loadLesson()` call to use your filename:
   ```javascript
   this.loadLesson('lessons/your-lesson-name.json');
   ```

### **Check These Elements:**
- âœ… **Welcome phase** displays properly with title/preview
- âœ… **Q1, Q2, Q3** show correct content
- âœ… **A/B choices** trigger appropriate teaching moments
- âœ… **Age switching** changes content appropriately
- âœ… **Wisdom phase** displays reflection/insight/growth
- âœ… **Progression** flows smoothly between phases

### **Common Issues:**
- **Missing age_adaptations**: Add at least 3 age versions
- **Long text**: Keep choices under 8 words, teaching moments under 3 sentences
- **JSON syntax**: Validate your JSON structure
- **File path**: Ensure correct folder and filename
