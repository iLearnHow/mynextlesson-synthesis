## Quality-First Replan (Executive Correction)

- We currently have **0 production-ready, gold-standard lessons**. Existing demos are placeholders for plumbing validation only and must not seed, train, or template production content.
- We will build a single **Gold‑Standard Lesson (GSL) v1.0** that exercises every icon/modal and the full 5‑phase experience at professional quality. Only after GSL acceptance do we scale to 366 days.
- Freeze: No precomputation or calendar freeze until the GSL passes acceptance. All generation must adhere to the GSL schema and tone standards.

### Gold‑Standard Lesson (GSL) v1.0 — Acceptance Criteria
Content
- 5 phases fully authored: Welcome, Beginning, Middle, End, Wisdom; each with voice‑over script, on‑screen text, and explicit learning objective linkage. Conversational tone only (no "Question one/two/three" scaffolding in narration).
- Three interactive questions across phases with age‑appropriate scaffolding, natural language choices (no A/B labels), and tailored teaching moments for each choice.
- Fortune/Wisdom segment that is reflective, non‑trivial, and aligned to the day’s concept; no generic platitudes.
- Audio‑first clarity: comprehensible without images; evokes mental visualization.
- No placeholders; no meta‑scaffolding language exposed to learners; polished microcopy throughout.

Interaction & Player Coverage (index.html icon/modals)
- Phase navigation: next/previous works across all 5 phases with correct state.
- Variant switcher: avatar, tone, age (in‑scope bands), and language switches update all visible content live.
- Question interactions: selectable options, feedback rendering, and progression function correctly.
- Transcript/closed captions: synchronized or phase‑aligned text available.
- Vocabulary/terms modal: curated glossary for the topic with precise, age‑aware definitions.
- Examples/try‑now modal: at least two concrete application prompts tied to the topic.
- Language toggle (Phase‑1 set): verified content parity (not machine literalism), tone‑safe translations.
- Playback/accessibility controls: all present controls function as intended (audio start/stop, replay phase, etc.).

Quality Bars
- Reviewers agree the lesson is engaging for diverse learners (children to adults) with layered depth and zero condescension.
- Rubric average ≥ 4.3 across dimensions; no dimension < 4.0 for Audio‑first, Integrity, Scaffoldability, Assessment Fit.
- Lint: zero placeholder strings; zero broken links; zero console errors.

Deliverables
- GSL content JSON in canonical schema; transcripts per phase; glossary; examples; question bank with feedback; acceptance checklist signed.
- Walkthrough script for QA to press every icon/modal and validate outcomes in the player.

### GSL Icon/Modal Coverage Matrix (Player IDs → Expected Behavior)
- live-modal: opens cleanly; no blocking state; close returns focus
- find-modal: search returns Day 1 result; click loads lesson and updates captions
- settings-modal: toggles do not break captions, audio, or variant state
- calendar-modal: Yesterday/Today/Tomorrow buttons load and render Day 1 boundary correctly
- language-modal: EN/ES/FR switch refetches PhaseDNA; captions update; narration text swaps
- tone-modal: Grandmother/Fun/Neutral swap; on-screen text remains consistent; tone hint lines swap where provided
- avatar-modal: Kelly/Ken swap; background/expressions update; content constant
- age-modal: Age swap updates age label; content remains adult‑capable (no infantilization)
- speed-modal: Playback speed applies to audio and is reflected in UI
- controls-modal: Prev/Next/Restart operate across all five phases without state loss

### QA Walkthrough (Pass/Fail Steps)
1) Load Day 1; verify captions show welcome line; press Play → audio and captions advance.
2) Open language-modal → switch ES → content reloads; open tone-modal → switch Fun → confirm tone microcopy where applicable.
3) Beginning phase: choose each option in turn; confirm tailored teaching moments and auto‑advance timing.
4) Middle phase: repeat A/B; confirm hint text and phase completion.
5) End phase: repeat A/B; confirm tilt/season explanation and completion.
6) Wisdom phase: confirm reflective close; Replay works.
7) Variant changes (avatar/age/speed) mid‑lesson do not break state.
8) Accessibility: focus trap within modals; Esc closes; keyboard navigation works on choices.

### Authoring Blueprint (GSL v1.0)
- Welcome (30–45s): human hook; why this matters today; sets the tone lens (fun/neutral/grandmother) without gimmick.
- Beginning (45–60s): core concept; one sticky analogy; common misconception called out gently.
- Middle (60–75s): application in daily life; guided choice; micro‑feedback regardless of choice.
- End (45–60s): synthesis; one small real‑world step; invitation to notice/measure something today.
- Wisdom (20–30s): reflective insight tied to universal values; not moralizing; energizing close.

### Guardrails — No Modeling from Placeholders
- Prohibit reuse of prior demo text as templates; start from blank, standards‑driven outlines.
- Ban scaffold words in UI text (e.g., “Option A/B”, “true/false”); ensure natural, conversational choices.
- Require double‑review: Content Lead + Pedagogy Lead sign‑off before QA.

### Revised Roadmap (Quality‑First)
1) Craft GSL outline → write scripts → internal red‑team review (language, age layers, tones).
2) Implement in player content schema; verify every icon/modal with the GSL payload.
3) QA pass with acceptance checklist; fix until criteria met; executive sign‑off.
4) Lock canonical schema from GSL; retrofit the audit rubric to weight patterns that drove excellence.
5) Scale: select first tranche of 14 topics across families; author at GSL standard (lighter variants allowed only where depth is preserved).
6) Proceed to 366 mapping and precompute only after tranche validation and rubric consistency.


## Universal Daily Topic Program (366): Audit and Reassignment Plan

### Purpose and Non‑Negotiables
- **Universal calendar**: The same topic is taught worldwide on each calendar date (e.g., everyone’s Aug 18 shares the same topic).
- **Audio‑first launch**: Topics must stand as spoken lessons without images; visuals will be added post‑launch but are not a selection criterion for v1.
- **Serve every learner**: Topics must scale across ages, languages, tones, and preferences; we avoid child‑only framing and enable adult rigor where desired.
- **Weekly balance, not randomness**: Calendar assignments intentionally mix domains each week to prevent monotony and cognitive fatigue.
- **Precompute where possible; on‑demand when missing**: If a variant is not precomputed, we produce it on demand via the DNA engine with metered compute costs.

### Topic Audit Rubric (0–5 per dimension)
Score each candidate topic across these dimensions. Minimum bar: **avg ≥ 3.8**, no dimension < 3 (except Temporal Anchor may be N/A).
- **Audio‑first teachability**: Can the concept be clearly taught via voice alone (definitions, relations, examples, misconceptions addressed)?
- **Mental visualization potential**: Does the script naturally evoke imagery learners can picture without screens?
- **Universal relevance**: Cross‑culture, cross‑age applicability without niche prerequisites or local bias.
- **Concept integrity & misconception risk**: Low risk of reinforcing common misconceptions; lends to precise but accessible framing.
- **Scaffoldability across ages**: Supports layered complexity for early childhood through adult expertise.
- **Variant elasticity**: Works well across tones (fun/neutral/grandmother), avatars, and content formats (3x3x3x3 / 3x2x2x2).
- **Language translatability**: Minimal idiom dependence; clear in multiple languages; stable terminology.
- **Cognitive load control**: Core idea can be taught within short, spoken segments with progressive complexity.
- **Engagement & curiosity spark**: Naturally prompts questions, choices, and reflection; inspires “try now” actions.
- **Assessment fit**: Maps cleanly to our question/feedback architectures without contrivance.
- **Temporal anchors (optional bonus)**: Aligns to seasonal moments or global observances (Pi Day, Earth Day, etc.) without being dependent on them.
- **Ethical/cultural sensitivity risk (reverse‑scored)**: Risks manageable with neutral framing and universal values.

Disqualifying flags (auto‑reject or revise):
- Requires diagrams/visuals to avoid misunderstanding.
- Highly culture‑bound or politically narrow without universal framing.
- Technically deep with no accessible on‑ramp within spoken constraints.
- High harm potential if simplified (health, safety, legal) without robust guardrails.

### Topic Taxonomy and Tags
Assign each topic to one primary family and 2–4 tags for scheduling diversity:
- **Natural World** (astronomy, geology, ecology)
- **Physical Science & Engineering** (physics, energy, machines)
- **Life Science & Health** (biology, physiology, wellbeing)
- **Math & Data** (number, structure, modeling, statistics)
- **Technology & Computing** (AI, networks, cybersecurity)
- **Civics, Society & History** (governance, rights, culture change)
- **Arts, Language & Culture** (literature, art history, expression)
- **Personal Skills & Habits** (planning, habits, communication)
- **Meta‑Learning & Thinking** (critical thinking, logic, reflection)
- **Work & Systems** (economics, urban planning, supply chains)

Required tags to aid scheduling: energy profile (wonder/skills/reflection), complexity band (intro/intermediate/advanced), sensitivity flag (none/medium/high), anchorable (Y/N).

### Weekly Mix Rules (7‑day windows)
To avoid topical clustering and cognitive fatigue, every 7‑day block must:
- **Diversity**: Include at least 5 distinct families; no family appears > 2 times.
- **Core coverage**: ≥1 Natural/Physical Science, ≥1 Math/Data, ≥1 Civics/Society/History, ≥1 Arts/Language/Culture, ≥1 Life Science/Health.
- **Learning modes**: ≥1 wonder day, ≥1 skills/practice day, ≥1 reflection/meaning day.
- **Load balance**: ≤2 “advanced” complexity topics; alternate heavier days with lighter ones.
- **Sensitivity guard**: Place any medium/high‑sensitivity topic adjacent to supportive or reflective topics; never stack sensitive topics.

### Calendar Assignment Rules (Universal, Non‑Random)
1) **Anchor dates first**: Map a subset of topics with natural global resonance (e.g., Mar 14 → Math & Data; Apr 22 → Natural World). Anchors are inspiration, not strict dependencies.
2) **Seasonal logic**: Place seasonally resonant topics where helpful (e.g., weather patterns), without requiring local seasons for comprehension.
3) **Weekly constraints pass**: Fill remaining dates to satisfy the Weekly Mix Rules across all rolling 7‑day windows.
4) **Adjacency checks**: No two days with the same primary family back‑to‑back, unless distinctly different energy profiles.
5) **Leap day policy**: Curate a special, evergreen “meta” topic for Day 60 (Feb 29) that stands uniquely and does not disrupt the weekly balance in non‑leap years.
6) **Stability**: Once approved, the universal calendar is fixed per version (v1.0). Later versions may shift with full change logs.

### Reassignment Workflow (Audit → Score → Place → Verify)
1) **Inventory**: Load all 365 current topics; add one new topic to reach 366 with a designated Leap Day anchor.
2) **Rubric scoring**: Two independent reviewers score each topic; differences >1.0 trigger reconciliation.
3) **Tagging**: Assign family, tags, energy profile, complexity band, sensitivity flag, anchorable.
4) **Placement**: 
   - Place anchors (10–25 dates) first.
   - Fill remaining days to satisfy weekly rules via constraint‑guided placement.
5) **Validation**: Rolling 7‑day scans for diversity, load, sensitivity spacing, and adjacency uniqueness.
6) **Governance**: Publish v1.0 mapping with rationale notes for stakeholders; freeze calendar and archive rationale.

### Deliverables
- **Audit Workbook (CSV/JSON)**: title, proposed day, rubric scores (12 dims), family, tags, energy, complexity, sensitivity, anchor note, rationale.
- **366‑Day Calendar Map**: fixed universal mapping (day‑of‑year → topic), including Leap Day.
- **Diversity & Load Report**: per‑week coverage stats, adjacency and sensitivity checks.
- **Revision Queue**: topics < threshold or flagged for risk; rewrite or replace recommendations.
- **Variant Emphasis Plan**: which topics will emphasize which tones/ages/languages based on elasticity and popularity hypotheses.
- **Change Log & Versioning**: v1.0 frozen calendar; future v1.x deltas documented.

### Precompute vs On‑Demand Policy
- **Precompute (default)**: Generate all approved variants for v1.0 (languages phased if needed). Store with per‑day manifests.
- **On‑demand fallback (metered)**: If a variant is missing or updated post‑freeze, generate via DNA engine on request; usage is metered to reflect compute and QA.
- **Parity requirements**: On‑demand outputs must conform to the canonical schema, pass validation, and be appended to the manifest with checksums.

### Quality Gates
- **Rubric threshold**: avg ≥ 3.8; no required dimension < 3.
- **Schema validation**: 100% pass on canonical lesson schema.
- **Weekly balance**: 100% rolling 7‑day windows meet mix rules.
- **Content lint**: <0.5% warnings; zero critical failures.
- **Sampling review**: 1–2% human audit per age/language band before freeze.

### Popularity, Corrections, and Learning Loops
- **Telemetry**: Track variant selections, completion, and skip rates to learn which tone/age/language mixes delight or confuse.
- **Corrections**: Topics with consistent friction or low scores enter a monthly revision lane; replacements follow the same rubric and scheduling rules.
- **A/B within bounds**: Limited A/Bs allowed for script nuance, not topic swaps, to preserve the universal calendar promise.

### Timeline (Content‑Only)
- Week 1: Audit rubric training; double‑blind scoring starts; tag taxonomy finalized; Leap Day topic defined.
- Week 2: Complete scoring; anchor placement; initial calendar draft; weekly rule validation.
- Week 3: Board review; revisions; v1.0 calendar freeze; precompute plan finalized.
- Week 4–5: Precompute generation (phased languages if required); validation; manifests; readiness report.

### Decisions Requested
- Approve audit rubric and minimum thresholds.
- Approve taxonomy, tags, and weekly mix rules.
- Approve universal calendar policy (anchors + stability per version).
- Approve precompute scope vs phased languages and the on‑demand metering policy.
